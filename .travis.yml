  - conda create --yes -n test python=$TRAVIS_PYTHON_VERSION
  - source activate test

  # Below, include the dependencies you want to install with conda, optionally
  # specifying versions used in the matrix above. If you split this into
  # multiple conda install commands, you should always include numpy=$NUMPY as
  # the first package to install (for every conda install command) otherwise
  # numpy may be automatically upgraded.

  #- conda install --yes

  # You can also install some dependencies with pip if not available in conda

  # - pip install ...
