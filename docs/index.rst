**RiboPipe**: *An assembly and analysis pipeline for sequencing data*
=====================================================================
**RiboPipe** is toolkit designed for automating the assembly,
quality control, and analysis of ribosome profiling and other single-end RNAseq
datasets. It is intended to be easy to use for bench and computational biologists
and is quick to use out of the box.

**RiboPipe** is developed by Jordan Berg in the `Rutter Lab <https://biochem.utah.edu/rutter/index.html>`_
@ the `University of Utah <https://www.utah.edu/>`_, along with other collaborators.
